# Bootstrap Italia Playground

Bootstrap Italia is a theme based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) to create responsive, mobile-first web applications.

Bootstrap Italia inherits all functionalities, components, mixins and gridsystem from Bootstrap 4, and adapts them to follow the [design guidelines for Italian Public Administrations web services](https://design-italia.readthedocs.io/it/stable/index.html).

## Getting started

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/italia/bootstrap-italia-playground.git`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Run a local server: `npm start`
* Point a browser to: `http://http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

## What's included

You'll find a plain HTML page linking empty CSS and JS files to enable styling. You are encouraged to edit anything inside the `<main>` tag to style the page.

```
bootstrap-italia-playground/
│   index.html          # main html file
├── css/
│   ├── docs.min.css    # a minified library used to style header and footer
│   ├── main.css        # working CSS file
├── js/
│   └── main.js         # working JS file
└── gallery/            # gallery of examples
```

# Exercises

If you open the exercise page, you will find an empty page which is not very interesting. It's time to create a beautiful website out of it and familiarizing with the power of Bootstrap and the Italia theme.

For these exercises we'll use the examples found at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/

## The blog

How would a blog look like with this theme? Luckily, since we use Bootstrap, we can take inspiration from their examples, and most of the standard components will be replaced by our customization.

Bootstrap has published an example of such a page here:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/


## The dashboard

Another useful example to try to recreate is a dashboard for a public service. You can get some inspiration here:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/dashboard/

## Create a beautiful example

Of course Boostrap's gallery has only very few examples, but imagining a service for citizens can create many more beautiful user interfaces.
Use your creativity, imagine a service, and try to create a mock UI using this tool.

## Submitting your work

We'd love to host a gallery of the most beautiful websites created with the Italia Boostrapt theme. If you have something to show us, please [send us a pull request]([https://github.com/italia/bootstrap-italia-playground#fork-destination-box])!
