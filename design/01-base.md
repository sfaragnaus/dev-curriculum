# Bootstrap Italia Playground

Bootstrap Italia is a theme based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) to create responsive, mobile-first web applications.

Bootstrap Italia inherits all functionalities, components, mixins and gridsystem from Bootstrap 4, and adapts them to follow the [design guidelines for Italian Public Administrations web services](https://design-italia.readthedocs.io/it/stable/index.html).

## Getting started
