# Bootstrap Italia Playground

Bootstrap Italia is a theme based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) to create responsive, mobile-first web applications.

Bootstrap Italia inherits all functionalities, components, mixins and gridsystem from Bootstrap 4, and adapts them to follow the [design guidelines for Italian Public Administrations web services](https://design-italia.readthedocs.io/it/stable/index.html).

With this activity you will learn how to hack and contribute on this toolkit.


# Prerequisites

In order to hack on the toolkit, you have to first download the source code and install any missing dependencies.

* Install Ruby, Node.js and bundler.
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/italia/bootstrap-italia.git`
* Install dependencies: `bundle install`

If you performed all the instructions correctly, you wil be able to see the documentation by typing `npm start`, which will launch jekyll.

You can find a more detailed explanation (in Italian) on https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/docs/come-iniziare/strumenti-di-compilazione/
